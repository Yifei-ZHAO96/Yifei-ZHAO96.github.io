I am deeply passionate about cutting-edge advancements in the field of machine learning, with a particular focus on state-of-the-art deep learning models, computer vision, natural language processing, and the development of large-scale language models. These dedicated interests have driven my pursuit of knowledge and innovation in the dynamic field of AI research, making me a committed contributor to the ongoing evolution of machine learning technologies.

I am presently employed as a machine learning researcher at Huawei Canada, where I have developed numerous data-driven, AI-assisted systems aimed at addressing Huawei's intricate and genuine networking challenges while enhancing network performance. I apply online ML/DL models to adapt to the ever-changing and unpredictable real-world system, and employ causal reasoning techniques to analyze anomalous behaviors in both the system and network.
