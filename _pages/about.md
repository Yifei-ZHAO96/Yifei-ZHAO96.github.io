I am presently employed as a machine learning researcher at Huawei Canada, where I have developed numerous data-driven, AI-assisted systems aimed at addressing Huawei's intricate and genuine networking challenges while enhancing network performance.

Before joining Huawei, I was under the guidance of Prof. Benoit Champagne at McGill University, where I successfully completed my M.Sc. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. During this time, I harnessed several cutting-edge deep learning techniques and models to enhance audio signal processing workflows.
