  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={Voice Activity Detection (VAD) aims to distinguish, at a given time, between desired speech and non-speech. Although many state-of-the-art approaches for increasing the performance of VAD have been proposed, they are still not robust enough to be applied under adverse noise conditions with low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). To deal with this issue, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture for VAD with reduced computational complexity by implementing efficient depth-wise convolutions on feature patches. The proposed model, named Tr-VAD, demonstrates better performance compared to baseline methods from the literature in a variety of scenarios considered with the smallest possible number of parameters. The results also indicate that the use of a combination of Audio Fingerprinting (AFP) features with Tr-VAD can guarantee better performance.},

  abstract={Although many state-of-the-art approaches for improving the accuracy of Voice Activity Detection (VAD) have been proposed, their performance under adverse noise conditions with low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) remains limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel attention model-based deep neural network (DNN) architecture for VAD which takes advantage of complex Ideal Ratio Mask (cIRM). The proposed model, named AM-cIRM, consists of three sequential modules: extraction of cIRM features from the noisy speech using a DNN-based architecture; combination of cIRM with log-Mel spectrogram features along with temporal contextual extension; and VAD using an attention model that exploits the spectro-temporal information in the transformed features. Experimental results show that the proposed AM-cIRM achieves improved VAD performance when compared to state-of-the-art methods under different noise conditions.},
